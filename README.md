# Templatr (in rust)
Implementation from the ground up, not based off the original templatr by cal177

Contains both a main entrypoint for binary usage and library methods if one intended to include it in another program.

Usage example: `templatr --git https://github.com/Lauriethefish/quest-mod-template.git ./dest_template`
